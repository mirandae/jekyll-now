UW has a really cool programming languages class called . which has some fastinating topics about constructing programming languages. My notes are drawn from that course, normally taught by Zach Tatlock or Dan Grossman.

Let's define a formal languge -- think more "logic language" than programming language like Java or C++.

First, some notation:

* := means variable assignment (i.e. x := 3)

* ::= means meta-assignment (uh)
