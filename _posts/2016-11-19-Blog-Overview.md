One thing I've noticed recently is that while I might walk away from a class confident that I've absorbed most of the material, I have trouble actually breaking down what I've learned to explain it to someone else. It ends up leaving me wondering if I've really internalized what I've learned. As a result, I'm trying to write up my own interpretation of concepts I come across in work, research, and school. Ideally, I'll understand things a little better and maybe my posts will help out some other lost undergrad stuck on the same topics as me.
