A term you might come across in learning about programming languages is *judgment.*
This is basically a relation. For example, last time the notion of evaluating a heap was a judgment:

$ H; c \Downarrow c $


It's not a term I plan to use a lot but in case you were wondering.


####Proofs


$ \dot{x} $
